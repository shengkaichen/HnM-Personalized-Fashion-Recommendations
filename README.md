# H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations

## About
The project seeks to use previous sales data, customer information, and other metadata to predict what clothing purchases users will make in the near future on the Kaggle competition. Creating a better recommendation algorithm can ensure the company provides better-personalized recommendations within the fashion industry, improve sales on those items, and generally help users find more clothing they like and ultimately improve the customer experience.
